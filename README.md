# SnakeGame

This project is a modern take on the classic Snake Game, developed in C++ with the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) framework. The application demonstrates strong use of object-oriented programming principles and incorporates both core gameplay mechanics and advanced features that make it stand out from a simple implementation.

Key Features

    Classic Snake Gameplay – Smooth movement, growth when eating food, and collision-based game-over conditions.
    
    Obstacles – Randomly placed blocks increase the difficulty and require strategic movement.
    
    Profiles & Statistics – Players can create and manage profiles, each storing personal preferences and best scores.
    
    Leaderboard – Persistent tracking of the highest scores across all profiles.
    
    Settings & Customization – Options to adjust snake color, game speed, and overall in-game appearance for a personalized experience.
    
    2D Graphics – Clean rendering using SFML for visuals, animations, and user interface menus.

Technical Highlights

    Built with C++ and SFML for efficient 2D graphics and game loop handling.
    
    Designed using modular OOP architecture (classes for Snake, Food, Obstacle, Game, PlayerProfile, UI).
    
    Implements file persistence to save/load player data and scores.
    
    Follows a structured game loop with input handling, game updates, and rendering.

Value of the Project

This project goes beyond a basic Snake clone by integrating profiles, persistent high scores, and customizable settings, showcasing both technical depth and attention to user experience. It highlights skills in:

    Game development with C++ and SFML
    
    Object-oriented design and clean architecture
    
    Data persistence and user profile management
    
    UI/UX considerations in games
